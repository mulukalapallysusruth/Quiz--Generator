The points that fall under the category of 'low rating and less liking' would be considered as the other category. This process of grouping points based on similarity is a common technique used in **Machine Learning Algorithms**.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: \nAnswer: How is machine learning different from conventional programming methods?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: 2. What is the difference between Machine Learning and Conventional Programming?\nAnswer: Machine Learning and Conventional Programming differ in the way they operate. In Conventional Programming, a programmer manually creates the logic of the program by hard coding instructions. On the other hand, Machine Learning relies on statistical models that learn from input data to perform tasks effectively. Machine Learning does not require explicit instructions from the programmer; instead, it relies on patterns and inference to make predictions. In summary, Conventional Programming involves manual coding of logic, while Machine Learning uses statistical models and data to automate the learning process.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion:    A) Machine Learning relies on human intervention, while Conventional Programming is automated\nAnswer: I don't know the answer to that question.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion:    B) Conventional Programming requires hard coding of logic, while Machine Learning learns from input data\nAnswer: Yes, that's correct.

It is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. The formula for range is:

Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value

If you have a dataset like [2, 5, 8, 10, 15], the range would be:

Range = 15 - 2 = 13

So, the range of this dataset is 13.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion:    B) Standard Deviation\nQuestion: 1.

1. **Mean**: Add up all the numbers in the data set and then divide by the total number of values in the set. For example, if you have the data set 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, you would calculate the mean as (2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 7) / 6 = 4.333.

2. **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the data set. In the example data set 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, the mode is 4 because it appears twice, which is more than any other number.

3. **Median**: To find the median, you need to arrange the data set in order from smallest to largest. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle number. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. In the example data set 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, the median is (4 + 4) / 2 = 4.

These are the steps to calculate the mean, mode, and median of a data set.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: \nAnswer: How is machine learning different from conventional programming methods?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Correct Answer: C) To make predictions about the larger population from a sample\nAnswer: The purpose of inferential statistics is to make predictions about the larger population from a sample.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: \nAnswer: I don't know.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: 4.
