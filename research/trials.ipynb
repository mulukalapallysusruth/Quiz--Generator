A tool or invention \\nmultiplies the effect of human effort.  A machine when invented reduced the human \\nintelligence.  \\nA learning is defined as the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or \\nbeing taught.   \\nNow, machine learning can be defined as the machine which was invented by human to reduce \\ntheir work is being made to learn and acquire the required knowledge through experience or \\nbeing taught by which it does some function with help of an algorithm is know as machine \\nlearning. The algorithm by which it does some function is called a ma chine learning algorithm.  \\nFor example, let us consider the case where there are people in the area where few likes spicy \\nflavored food and few likes less spicy flavor and some may even dislike the spicy flavored food. \\nBy taking a survey and with the collec ted data a graph is being plotted where the points in blue \\ncolor are the people who likes the spicy flavor in the food and had given high rating for the \\nfood. And the brown points are given by people who dislikes or shown less likings than others \\ntowards t he spicy flavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use or distribution prohibited.  The points that are closer and falls under the category of ‘liking and high rating’ are grouped \\ntogether which means any points that lies under that category is considered that the person \\nhas liking towards the flavor of food. The  points that fall under the category of ‘low rating and \\nless liking’ would be considered as the other category.  \\nNow, with this category when a new person is added to the mass and when the survey is again \\ntaken and those points are being marked, now the ana lysis can be easily made and the \\nrestaurants to be opened in that area can make dishes accordingly to grow their business \\naccording to the people’s choice of taste.  \\nSo, if the area people on high range has shown interest towards high spicy foods then the \\nrestaurants can cook food which are spicy and if the area people had shown interest to less \\nspicy food then the restaurant can cook food accordingly and alter their food in their menu  \\nThis is one such case where machine learning can be applied and is useful  to grow a business \\nand improve the growth.  \\n \\n \\n \\nNow, the circle is drawn around the points for a minimum nearby distance to understand the \\nrelation which is a famous machine learning algorithm K -means , by using this algorithm we can \\nnow predict that the p erson whose point is depicted as purple falls under ‘disliking spicy food’ \\nas the number of points lying near that point is of those who has given less rating for the spicy \\nflavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content.

Hence, by using this we can predict the needed outcome.  \\n \\nMACHINE LE ARNING SIGNIFICANCE  \\nMachine learning as said simplifies a large problem, thereby reducing the human intervention and \\nhandles to solve the problem at ease.  Some of the major problems were solved by applying machine -\\nlearning  concepts and advancements has be en done in many field.  \\nFor example, fraud detection which required human intelligence but now using the machine -learning \\nalgorithm the fraud detection is done efficiently than human. For  this  it requires a dataset and a \\nmachine -learning algorithm by which a machine learning model can be built to predict the output.  \\nWhen it comes to machine learning the system is doing the job of human, and how does the system \\ndoes this? Whether it is being tra ined or is it being dictated to do?. So, for this question the machine \\nlearning can be categorized into below methods of learning .  \\n1. SUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n3. SEMI - SUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n4. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING  \\nWhen is machine learning is being  useful?  \\nThe machine learning concept is used in many fields some are being listed  \\nHEALTH CARE:  Now, it is possible to pred ict the heart attack death rate, birth rate in an area and many \\nsuch useful insights which can help to take necessary actions based o n the outcome.  \\nEDUCATION: To analyze the performance of the students, and to predict the results in the forth coming \\nyear with the past history datasets.  \\nFINANCIAL SERVICES: Fraud detection, loan prediction and all such analysis can be made to enhance the \\nrespective fields using machine learning algorithm.  \\nHow is machine learning different from AI and Deep learning?   \\nProprietary content.

Deep learning describes algorithms that analyze data \\nwith a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning relies on a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural \\nnetwork.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning has huge data needs but requires little human intervention to function \\nproperly.  \\n\\uf0b7 Transfer learning is a cure for the needs of large training datasets.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn the above given exam ple ,  \\nFeature extraction refers to the  process of transforming raw data into numerical features  that \\ncan be processed while preserving the information in the original data set  \\nMACHINE LEARNING VS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  \\n \\nProprietary content.

AI solves tasks that require human intelligence while ML is a subset of artificial intelligence that \\nsolves specific tasks by learning from data and making predictions. Artificial intelligence is a \\ntechnology which enables a machine to simulate human behavior.

A tool or invention \\nmultiplies the effect of human effort.  A machine when invented reduced the human \\nintelligence.  \\nA learning is defined as the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or \\nbeing taught.   \\nNow, machine learning can be defined as the machine which was invented by human to reduce \\ntheir work is being made to learn and acquire the required knowledge through experience or \\nbeing taught by which it does some function with help of an algorithm is know as machine \\nlearning. The algorithm by which it does some function is called a ma chine learning algorithm.  \\nFor example, let us consider the case where there are people in the area where few likes spicy \\nflavored food and few likes less spicy flavor and some may even dislike the spicy flavored food. \\nBy taking a survey and with the collec ted data a graph is being plotted where the points in blue \\ncolor are the people who likes the spicy flavor in the food and had given high rating for the \\nfood. And the brown points are given by people who dislikes or shown less likings than others \\ntowards t he spicy flavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved.

The points that are closer and falls under the category of ‘liking and high rating’ are grouped \\ntogether which means any points that lies under that category is considered that the person \\nhas liking towards the flavor of food. The  points that fall under the category of ‘low rating and \\nless liking’ would be considered as the other category.  \\nNow, with this category when a new person is added to the mass and when the survey is again \\ntaken and those points are being marked, now the ana lysis can be easily made and the \\nrestaurants to be opened in that area can make dishes accordingly to grow their business \\naccording to the people’s choice of taste.  \\nSo, if the area people on high range has shown interest towards high spicy foods then the \\nrestaurants can cook food which are spicy and if the area people had shown interest to less \\nspicy food then the restaurant can cook food accordingly and alter their food in their menu  \\nThis is one such case where machine learning can be applied and is useful  to grow a business \\nand improve the growth.  \\n \\n \\n \\nNow, the circle is drawn around the points for a minimum nearby distance to understand the \\nrelation which is a famous machine learning algorithm K -means , by using this algorithm we can \\nnow predict that the p erson whose point is depicted as purple falls under ‘disliking spicy food’ \\nas the number of points lying near that point is of those who has given less rating for the spicy \\nflavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content.

      "\n",
      "2. Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics is a fancy name for methods that aid in quantifying properties of the domain or population from a smaller set of obtained observations called a sample. It involves making inferences and predictions about the larger population from which the sample is drawn.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:  C) Machine Learning vs Deep Learning\n",
      "Answer:  Machine learning and deep learning are related concepts, but there are some key differences between them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Definition**: \n",
      "   - **Machine Learning**: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.\n",
      "   - **Deep Learning**: Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and process complex patterns in large amounts of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complexity**:\n",
      "   - **Machine Learning**: Machine learning algorithms are generally less complex than deep learning algorithms. They are suitable for a wide range of tasks and datasets.\n",
      "   - **Deep Learning**: Deep learning algorithms are more complex and require a large amount of data to train effectively. They are particularly useful for tasks like image and speech recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Data Requirements**:\n",
      "   - **Machine Learning**: Machine learning algorithms can work well with smaller datasets and do not always require massive amounts of data.\n",
      "   - **Deep Learning**: Deep learning algorithms typically require large amounts of data to train effectively due to the complexity of the neural networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Human Intervention**:\n",
      "   - **Machine Learning**: Machine learning algorithms often require more human intervention in feature engineering and model selection.\n",
      "   - **Deep Learning**: Deep learning algorithms can automatically learn features from the data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Applications**:\n",
      "   - **Machine Learning**: Machine learning is used in a wide range of applications, including recommendation systems, fraud detection, and predictive analytics.\n",
      "   - **Deep Learning**: Deep learning is particularly effective in tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, deep learning is a more specialized and complex subset of machine learning that excels in handling large amounts of data and complex patterns, while machine learning is a broader field that encompasses a variety of algorithms and techniques for learning from data.\n",

      "Answer:  To calculate the mean, mode, and median of a data set, you would follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mean**: Add up all the numbers in the data set and then divide by the total number of values in the set. For example, if you have the data set 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, you would calculate the mean as (2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 7) / 6 = 4.333.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the data set. In the example data set 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, the mode is 4 because it appears twice, which is more than any other number.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Median**: To find the median, you need to arrange the data set in order from smallest to largest. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle number. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. In the example data set 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, the median is (4 + 4) / 2 = 4.\n",

      "Question:  4. How is Deep Learning different from Machine Learning?\n",
      "Answer:  Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning. It relies on a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural network. Deep learning algorithms analyze data with a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions. Deep learning requires huge amounts of data but requires little human intervention to function properly. Transfer learning is a method used to address the need for large training datasets in deep learning.\n",

      "Question:  B) Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, focusing on artificial neural networks\n",
      "Answer:  Yes, that statement is correct. Deep Learning is indeed a subset of Machine Learning that specifically focuses on artificial neural networks.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:  C) Deep Learning requires large training datasets, while Machine Learning requires little human intervention\n",
      "Answer:  Yes, that statement is accurate. Deep learning algorithms, which are a subset of machine learning, typically require large training datasets to function effectively. On the other hand, traditional machine learning algorithms can often work with smaller datasets and require less human intervention once they are set up and trained.\n",
