A tool or invention \\nmultiplies the effect of human effort.  A machine when invented reduced the human \\nintelligence.  \\nA learning is defined as the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or \\nbeing taught.   \\nNow, machine learning can be defined as the machine which was invented by human to reduce \\ntheir work is being made to learn and acquire the required knowledge through experience or \\nbeing taught by which it does some function with help of an algorithm is know as machine \\nlearning. The algorithm by which it does some function is called a ma chine learning algorithm.  \\nFor example, let us consider the case where there are people in the area where few likes spicy \\nflavored food and few likes less spicy flavor and some may even dislike the spicy flavored food. \\nBy taking a survey and with the collec ted data a graph is being plotted where the points in blue \\ncolor are the people who likes the spicy flavor in the food and had given high rating for the \\nfood. And the brown points are given by people who dislikes or shown less likings than others \\ntowards t he spicy flavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use or distribution prohibited.  The points that are closer and falls under the category of ‘liking and high rating’ are grouped \\ntogether which means any points that lies under that category is considered that the person \\nhas liking towards the flavor of food. The  points that fall under the category of ‘low rating and \\nless liking’ would be considered as the other category.  \\nNow, with this category when a new person is added to the mass and when the survey is again \\ntaken and those points are being marked, now the ana lysis can be easily made and the \\nrestaurants to be opened in that area can make dishes accordingly to grow their business \\naccording to the people’s choice of taste.  \\nSo, if the area people on high range has shown interest towards high spicy foods then the \\nrestaurants can cook food which are spicy and if the area people had shown interest to less \\nspicy food then the restaurant can cook food accordingly and alter their food in their menu  \\nThis is one such case where machine learning can be applied and is useful  to grow a business \\nand improve the growth.  \\n \\n \\n \\nNow, the circle is drawn around the points for a minimum nearby distance to understand the \\nrelation which is a famous machine learning algorithm K -means , by using this algorithm we can \\nnow predict that the p erson whose point is depicted as purple falls under ‘disliking spicy food’ \\nas the number of points lying near that point is of those who has given less rating for the spicy \\nflavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content.

Hence, by using this we can predict the needed outcome.  \\n \\nMACHINE LE ARNING SIGNIFICANCE  \\nMachine learning as said simplifies a large problem, thereby reducing the human intervention and \\nhandles to solve the problem at ease.  Some of the major problems were solved by applying machine -\\nlearning  concepts and advancements has be en done in many field.  \\nFor example, fraud detection which required human intelligence but now using the machine -learning \\nalgorithm the fraud detection is done efficiently than human. For  this  it requires a dataset and a \\nmachine -learning algorithm by which a machine learning model can be built to predict the output.  \\nWhen it comes to machine learning the system is doing the job of human, and how does the system \\ndoes this? Whether it is being tra ined or is it being dictated to do?. So, for this question the machine \\nlearning can be categorized into below methods of learning .  \\n1. SUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n3. SEMI - SUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n4. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING  \\nWhen is machine learning is being  useful?  \\nThe machine learning concept is used in many fields some are being listed  \\nHEALTH CARE:  Now, it is possible to pred ict the heart attack death rate, birth rate in an area and many \\nsuch useful insights which can help to take necessary actions based o n the outcome.  \\nEDUCATION: To analyze the performance of the students, and to predict the results in the forth coming \\nyear with the past history datasets.  \\nFINANCIAL SERVICES: Fraud detection, loan prediction and all such analysis can be made to enhance the \\nrespective fields using machine learning algorithm.  \\nHow is machine learning different from AI and Deep learning?   \\nProprietary content.

Deep learning describes algorithms that analyze data \\nwith a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning relies on a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural \\nnetwork.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning has huge data needs but requires little human intervention to function \\nproperly.  \\n\\uf0b7 Transfer learning is a cure for the needs of large training datasets.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn the above given exam ple ,  \\nFeature extraction refers to the  process of transforming raw data into numerical features  that \\ncan be processed while preserving the information in the original data set  \\nMACHINE LEARNING VS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  \\n \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use or distribution prohibited.  AI solves tasks that require human intelligence while ML is a subset of artificial intelligence that \\nsolves specific tasks by learning from data and making predictions. Artificial intelligence is a \\ntechnology which enables a machine to simulate human behavior. Machine learning is a subset \\nof AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past data without programming \\nexplicitly.  AI system is concerned about maximizing the chances of success. Machine learning is \\nmainly concerned about accuracy and patterns.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCONVENTIONAL PROGRA MMING METHODS  \\nConventional programming is a manual process, which means the programmer creates the logic \\nof the program.  Conventional Programming  uses conventional procedural language. It could be \\nassembly language or a high -level language such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc. \\nConventional programming is a manual process, which means the programmer creates the logic \\nof the program.  \\nHere the programmer gives the input and creates the logic for which the output is generated  \\nHow is machine learning different from Conventional method ? \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nProprietary content.

A tool or invention \\nmultiplies the effect of human effort.  A machine when invented reduced the human \\nintelligence.  \\nA learning is defined as the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or \\nbeing taught.   \\nNow, machine learning can be defined as the machine which was invented by human to reduce \\ntheir work is being made to learn and acquire the required knowledge through experience or \\nbeing taught by which it does some function with help of an algorithm is know as machine \\nlearning. The algorithm by which it does some function is called a ma chine learning algorithm.  \\nFor example, let us consider the case where there are people in the area where few likes spicy \\nflavored food and few likes less spicy flavor and some may even dislike the spicy flavored food. \\nBy taking a survey and with the collec ted data a graph is being plotted where the points in blue \\ncolor are the people who likes the spicy flavor in the food and had given high rating for the \\nfood. And the brown points are given by people who dislikes or shown less likings than others \\ntowards t he spicy flavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved.

The points that are closer and falls under the category of ‘liking and high rating’ are grouped \\ntogether which means any points that lies under that category is considered that the person \\nhas liking towards the flavor of food. The  points that fall under the category of ‘low rating and \\nless liking’ would be considered as the other category.  \\nNow, with this category when a new person is added to the mass and when the survey is again \\ntaken and those points are being marked, now the ana lysis can be easily made and the \\nrestaurants to be opened in that area can make dishes accordingly to grow their business \\naccording to the people’s choice of taste.  \\nSo, if the area people on high range has shown interest towards high spicy foods then the \\nrestaurants can cook food which are spicy and if the area people had shown interest to less \\nspicy food then the restaurant can cook food accordingly and alter their food in their menu  \\nThis is one such case where machine learning can be applied and is useful  to grow a business \\nand improve the growth.  \\n \\n \\n \\nNow, the circle is drawn around the points for a minimum nearby distance to understand the \\nrelation which is a famous machine learning algorithm K -means , by using this algorithm we can \\nnow predict that the p erson whose point is depicted as purple falls under ‘disliking spicy food’ \\nas the number of points lying near that point is of those who has given less rating for the spicy \\nflavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content.
