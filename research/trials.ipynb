A tool or invention \\nmultiplies the effect of human effort.  A machine when invented reduced the human \\nintelligence.  \\nA learning is defined as the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or \\nbeing taught.   \\nNow, machine learning can be defined as the machine which was invented by human to reduce \\ntheir work is being made to learn and acquire the required knowledge through experience or \\nbeing taught by which it does some function with help of an algorithm is know as machine \\nlearning. The algorithm by which it does some function is called a ma chine learning algorithm.  \\nFor example, let us consider the case where there are people in the area where few likes spicy \\nflavored food and few likes less spicy flavor and some may even dislike the spicy flavored food. \\nBy taking a survey and with the collec ted data a graph is being plotted where the points in blue \\ncolor are the people who likes the spicy flavor in the food and had given high rating for the \\nfood. And the brown points are given by people who dislikes or shown less likings than others \\ntowards t he spicy flavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use or distribution prohibited.  The points that are closer and falls under the category of ‘liking and high rating’ are grouped \\ntogether which means any points that lies under that category is considered that the person \\nhas liking towards the flavor of food. The  points that fall under the category of ‘low rating and \\nless liking’ would be considered as the other category.  \\nNow, with this category when a new person is added to the mass and when the survey is again \\ntaken and those points are being marked, now the ana lysis can be easily made and the \\nrestaurants to be opened in that area can make dishes accordingly to grow their business \\naccording to the people’s choice of taste.  \\nSo, if the area people on high range has shown interest towards high spicy foods then the \\nrestaurants can cook food which are spicy and if the area people had shown interest to less \\nspicy food then the restaurant can cook food accordingly and alter their food in their menu  \\nThis is one such case where machine learning can be applied and is useful  to grow a business \\nand improve the growth.  \\n \\n \\n \\nNow, the circle is drawn around the points for a minimum nearby distance to understand the \\nrelation which is a famous machine learning algorithm K -means , by using this algorithm we can \\nnow predict that the p erson whose point is depicted as purple falls under ‘disliking spicy food’ \\nas the number of points lying near that point is of those who has given less rating for the spicy \\nflavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content.

Hence, by using this we can predict the needed outcome.  \\n \\nMACHINE LE ARNING SIGNIFICANCE  \\nMachine learning as said simplifies a large problem, thereby reducing the human intervention and \\nhandles to solve the problem at ease.  Some of the major problems were solved by applying machine -\\nlearning  concepts and advancements has be en done in many field.  \\nFor example, fraud detection which required human intelligence but now using the machine -learning \\nalgorithm the fraud detection is done efficiently than human. For  this  it requires a dataset and a \\nmachine -learning algorithm by which a machine learning model can be built to predict the output.  \\nWhen it comes to machine learning the system is doing the job of human, and how does the system \\ndoes this? Whether it is being tra ined or is it being dictated to do?. So, for this question the machine \\nlearning can be categorized into below methods of learning .  \\n1. SUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n3. SEMI - SUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n4. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING  \\nWhen is machine learning is being  useful?  \\nThe machine learning concept is used in many fields some are being listed  \\nHEALTH CARE:  Now, it is possible to pred ict the heart attack death rate, birth rate in an area and many \\nsuch useful insights which can help to take necessary actions based o n the outcome.  \\nEDUCATION: To analyze the performance of the students, and to predict the results in the forth coming \\nyear with the past history datasets.  \\nFINANCIAL SERVICES: Fraud detection, loan prediction and all such analysis can be made to enhance the \\nrespective fields using machine learning algorithm.  \\nHow is machine learning different from AI and Deep learning?   \\nProprietary content.

Deep learning describes algorithms that analyze data \\nwith a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning relies on a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural \\nnetwork.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning has huge data needs but requires little human intervention to function \\nproperly.  \\n\\uf0b7 Transfer learning is a cure for the needs of large training datasets.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn the above given exam ple ,  \\nFeature extraction refers to the  process of transforming raw data into numerical features  that \\ncan be processed while preserving the information in the original data set  \\nMACHINE LEARNING VS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  \\n \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use or distribution prohibited.  AI solves tasks that require human intelligence while ML is a subset of artificial intelligence that \\nsolves specific tasks by learning from data and making predictions. Artificial intelligence is a \\ntechnology which enables a machine to simulate human behavior. Machine learning is a subset \\nof AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past data without programming \\nexplicitly.  AI system is concerned about maximizing the chances of success. Machine learning is \\nmainly concerned about accuracy and patterns.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCONVENTIONAL PROGRA MMING METHODS  \\nConventional programming is a manual process, which means the programmer creates the logic \\nof the program.  Conventional Programming  uses conventional procedural language. It could be \\nassembly language or a high -level language such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc. \\nConventional programming is a manual process, which means the programmer creates the logic \\nof the program.  \\nHere the programmer gives the input and creates the logic for which the output is generated  \\nHow is machine learning different from Conventional method ? \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nProprietary content.

The  points that fall under the category of ‘low rating and \\nless liking’ would be considered as the other category.  \\nNow, with this category when a new person is added to the mass and when the survey is again \\ntaken and those points are being marked, now the ana lysis can be easily made and the \\nrestaurants to be opened in that area can make dishes accordingly to grow their business \\naccording to the people’s choice of taste.  \\nSo, if the area people on high range has shown interest towards high spicy foods then the \\nrestaurants can cook food which are spicy and if the area people had shown interest to less \\nspicy food then the restaurant can cook food accordingly and alter their food in their menu  \\nThis is one such case where machine learning can be applied and is useful  to grow a business \\nand improve the growth.  \\n \\n \\n \\nNow, the circle is drawn around the points for a minimum nearby distance to understand the \\nrelation which is a famous machine learning algorithm K -means , by using this algorithm we can \\nnow predict that the p erson whose point is depicted as purple falls under ‘disliking spicy food’ \\nas the number of points lying near that point is of those who has given less rating for the spicy \\nflavored food.  \\n \\n \\nProprietary content.

Some of the major problems were solved by applying machine -\\nlearning  concepts and advancements has be en done in many field.  \\nFor example, fraud detection which required human intelligence but now using the machine -learning \\nalgorithm the fraud detection is done efficiently than human. For  this  it requires a dataset and a \\nmachine -learning algorithm by which a machine learning model can be built to predict the output.  \\nWhen it comes to machine learning the system is doing the job of human, and how does the system \\ndoes this? Whether it is being tra ined or is it being dictated to do?. So, for this question the machine \\nlearning can be categorized into below methods of learning .  \\n1. SUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n3. SEMI - SUPERVISED LEARNING  \\n4. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING  \\nWhen is machine learning is being  useful?  \\nThe machine learning concept is used in many fields some are being listed  \\nHEALTH CARE:  Now, it is possible to pred ict the heart attack death rate, birth rate in an area and many \\nsuch useful insights which can help to take necessary actions based o n the outcome.  \\nEDUCATION: To analyze the performance of the students, and to predict the results in the forth coming \\nyear with the past history datasets.  \\nFINANCIAL SERVICES: Fraud detection, loan prediction and all such analysis can be made to enhance the \\nrespective fields using machine learning algorithm.  \\nHow is machine learning different from AI and Deep learning?   \\nProprietary content.

Deep learning describes algorithms that analyze data \\nwith a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning relies on a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural \\nnetwork.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep learning has huge data needs but requires little human intervention to function \\nproperly.  \\n\\uf0b7 Transfer learning is a cure for the needs of large training datasets.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn the above given exam ple ,  \\nFeature extraction refers to the  process of transforming raw data into numerical features  that \\ncan be processed while preserving the information in the original data set  \\nMACHINE LEARNING VS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  \\n \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use or distribution prohibited.  AI solves tasks that require human intelligence while ML is a subset of artificial intelligence that \\nsolves specific tasks by learning from data and making predictions. Artificial intelligence is a \\ntechnology which enables a machine to simulate human behavior. Machine learning is a subset \\nof AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past data without programming \\nexplicitly.  AI system is concerned about maximizing the chances of success. Machine learning is \\nmainly concerned about accuracy and patterns.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCONVENTIONAL PROGRA MMING METHODS  \\nConventional programming is a manual process, which means the programmer creates the logic \\nof the program.  Conventional Programming  uses conventional procedural language. It could be \\nassembly language or a high -level language such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc. \\nConventional programming is a manual process, which means the programmer creates the logic \\nof the program.  \\nHere the programmer gives the input and creates the logic for which the output is generated  \\nHow is machine learning different from Conventional method ? \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use or distribution prohibited.  In conventional programming, a programmer needs to hard code the logic of the program. In \\nmachine learning, it depends a lot on the machine which learns from input data.  The computer \\nsystems  use these statistical models to perform a specific task effectively. Here you don’t need \\nto provide explicit instructions; instead, it relies on  patterns  and inference.  \\nFor example let us consider a scenario where a person wins if he scores above 10 0 and losses of \\nhe scores below 100, for this in conventional programming the programmer writes the logic of \\nthe code and an input is given to get desired output  \\nIn machine learning, a dataset containing of the numbers with output is fitted and trained wit h \\na machine learning algorithm after with a model is trained to predict whatever input is given to \\npredict the output.  \\nUnlike traditional programming, machine learning is an automated process. It  can increase the \\nvalue of your embedded analytics in many areas, including data prep, natural language \\ninterfaces, automatic outlier detection, recommendations, and causality and significance \\ndetection.  \\n \\n \\nSTATISTICS  \\n Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, \\nanalyzi ng, interpreting and presenting data. Statistical measure are mean, mode, range, and \\nstandard deviation.  Statistics is a tool that helps us to extract information and knowledge from \\ndata.  \\nFor example In a classroom there can be many students, and to analyz e the performance of the \\nstudent and make useful insights we can use statistics.  \\nStatistics in machine learning can be classified based on the steps,  \\nSTATISTICS IN DATA PREPARATION  \\nA basic understanding of data distributions, descriptive statistics, and da ta visualization is \\nrequired to help you identify the methods to choose when performing these tasks.  \\nSTATISTICS IN MODEL EVALUATION  \\nStatistical methods are required when evaluating the skill of a machine learning model on data \\nnot seen during training.  \\nSTATISTICS IN MODEL PREDICTION  \\nStatistical methods are required when presenting the skill of a final model to stakeholder. This \\nmight include estimation statistics such as prediction intervals.  \\nStatistics can be broadly classified into   \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved.

Descriptive Statistics:  Descriptive statistics refer to methods for summarizing raw observations \\ninto information that we can understand and share.  \\nInferential Statistics: Inferential statistics is a fancy name for methods that aid in quantifying \\nproperties of the domain or popu lation from a smaller set of obtained observations called a \\nsample.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  \\n Descriptive statistics mainly deals with two factors namely,  \\n1. Measure of central tendencies  \\n2. Measure of variability  \\nMEASURE OF CENTRAL TENDANCY  \\n The measure of central tendency calculates a single value that describes the set of data by \\nidentifying the central position within the set of data. The valid measures of central tendency are,  \\n1. MEAN  \\n2. MODE  \\n3. MEDIAN  \\n \\nProprietary content. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use or distribution prohibited.   \\n \\n \\nExample  \\n \\nLet us consider a set of data 2 ,3,4,4,6,7 as the data set of people in a family living in the area A. Now to \\ncalculate the mean, mode, and median.  \\nTo calculate mean, which is the arithmetic mean of the continuous data  \\n  2+3+4+4+6+7/6=4.333 is the mean value  \\n \\nTo calculate median, which is the middle value of the data set   we need to arrange the data set in order \\nand then calculate, since the data set is in order we can directly infer the median.  \\nSince there are two middle value 4 and 4 we need to add those and divide by 2 to find the med ian value.  \\n  4+4/2=4 is the median value of the data set  \\n \\nTo calculate mode, which shows the number that occurs frequently  \\n  The number 4 occurs frequently in the given data set hence  4 is the mode.  \\n \\nProprietary content.

Variability  describes how \\nfar apart  data  points lie from each other and from the center of a distribution.  Variability is measured on \\nbasis of,  \\n1. Range  \\n2. Standard deviation  \\n3. Variance  \\n \\nRANGE  \\nIn statistics, the range of a set of data is the difference between the largest and smallest values. \\nDifference here is specific, the range of a set of data is the result of subtracting the sample maximum \\nand minimum . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRANGE = MAXIMUM VALUE -MINIMUM VALUE  \\n \\nProprietary content.
